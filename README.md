How do I run TUBAME?
==============

TUBAME is the Eclipse Plugin. So all you have to do for using TUBAME is to put it's binaries into Eclipse plugins folder.  
The Dependency Searching Function is ready-to-use as soon as you install it in Eclipse, and also you can use the Knowledge-Based Function without any additional operations if you use Rule-Sets provided by TUBAME community.
Or you can define your own Rule-Set by Knowledge Manager. By using Knowledge Manager you can make detailed Guideline for migration.  

To try and understand TUBAME it's the better way to use Rule-Sets (now JBoss EAP4 to EAP6 available) provided by [TUBAME](https://github.com/TUBAME/migration-knowledge/releases).
From now on TUBAME will provide Rule-Sets gradually, such as migration on WebLogic to JBoss EAP6.
And we expect and appreciate that you share your own Rule-Sets. Your contribution will make TUBAME fly higher!

Please see following manuals for more details about installation.
